# blog-api

a Blog API using the full set of Django REST Framework features. It will have users, permissions, and allow for full CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality.

## api endpoints

we don't normally write a lot of code when using django rest_framework, all we just have to do is to update the views.py class . that is what we are passing to the class method.
